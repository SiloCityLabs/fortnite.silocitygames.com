            SiloCityPages, developed by SiloCityLabs, is a streamlined framework
            designed to accelerate the development and deployment of static
            websites. Leveraging the power of Bootstrap for responsive design,
            React for component-driven architecture, and Next.js for efficient
            rendering, SiloCityPages provides a robust foundation for building
            modern web applications. Optimized for seamless deployment to GitHub
            Pages, this framework simplifies the process of creating and hosting
            performant, visually appealing websites, allowing developers to
            focus on content and functionality rather than complex
            configurations.
